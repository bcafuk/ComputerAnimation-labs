# Computer Animation laboratory assignments

This repository contains my solution to the first laboratory exercise for the
[Computer Animation course](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/comani_a) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing at the University of Zagreb, Croatia.

Computer Animation is a graduate-level course.
Building upon the undergraduate-level [Interactive Computer Graphics course](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/icg_a),
it introduces concepts such as splines, forward and inverse kinematics, particle systems, and collision detection.

For the course, students are expected to complete three laboratory assignments:
1. [following a path (B-splines)](lab1),
2. [particle systems](lab2), and
3. [an assignment with a free choice of topic](lab3).

For the final assignment, I decided to recreate elements of Sega's 1986 arcade game [Out Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run).

The original Croatian text of these assignments is available on [the course's pages](http://www.zemris.fer.hr/predmeti/ra/laboratorijske_vjezbe.html).
